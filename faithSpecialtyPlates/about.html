	<p class="pl-2 pr-2 pb-3">Today, faith-based programs have been developed to provide disaster relief, medical aid, hunger relief, clean water, and orphan/vulnerable child care to suffering communities around the world.  </p>

	<a href="about.html"><img class="aImg img-fluid w-50 pr-2 float-right" src="images/giveLoveAndHope.png" alt="image of a journal, eyeglasses, and a cup of coffee" /></a>
	<p class="pl-2 pr-1 pb-3">The first chapter of the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation, known as Tzu Chi USA, was established in Alhambra, Calif., in 1989. It all began when Stephen Huang, a wealthy American businessman seeking personal guidance, visited Dharma Master Cheng Yen in Taiwan. The meeting changed his life. There he met a gentle nun who had created a powerful organization, and who was able to realize one seemingly impossible dream after another, solely for the benefit of others. Huang was so filled with awe and admiration that he became a disciple and vowed to bring the spirit and mission of Tzu Chi to the United States. He did just that by making Tzu Chi USA the first chapter of Tzu Chi overseas.</p>
	
	
	<p class="pl-2 pr-1 pb-3">Tzu Chi USA began by mobilizing volunteers, then hosting “tea parties” where they could share their thoughts, experiences, and joy of volunteering. The events drew supporters and quickly inspired the creation of additional chapters. Today, Tzu Chi USA has 57 offices and facilities throughout the U.S., with volunteers and donors working tirelessly to make a difference in their communities.</p>
