# Faith Specialty Plates
an undergraduate assignment part of the Website Design and Development degree program at Full Sail University (February 2020)

Faith Specialty Plates is a non-profit organization that helps to raise funds for the different organizations that put God first in their mission to help, connect, and bring people together. None of the plates are meant to favor one religious’ group over another; instead, it’s meant to bring together all who have Faith in God. Faith Specialty Plates mission is to “help people nationwide where the need is greatest, by connecting the public with humanitarian organizations that work with the poor and the oppressed; to promote human transformation and bear witness to the good news of God.”

The website will be accessible for multiple device sizes. It will be designed with the mobile first approach and then work its way up in size. Once the website is running the site will be tested in multiple browsers, to provide the user with a seamless user experience. Visit https://jenplaza.github.io/faithspecialtyplates/about.html
